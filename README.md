# Waze App Analysis: Understanding User Behavior and Engagement

This project analyzes user activity data from the Waze app to uncover trends in driver behavior, app engagement, and session frequency. It was completed as part of a data science certification course to demonstrate exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data storytelling skills.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To explore and understand user behavior using the Waze app data and generate visual insights  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, feature analysis, data visualization, user segmentation

## Key Questions Explored

- How often do users interact with the app?
- Is there a correlation between session count and number of drives?
- Which users are highly engaged vs. at risk of churning?
- What patterns exist in user behavior based on usage frequency?

## Sample Visualizations

- Box plots showing drive distributions
- Scatter plots of sessions vs. drives
- Histograms of user activity levels

## Highlights and Insights

- A small percentage of users generate a large number of drives
- Many users have low engagement â€” potential churn risk
- Session count is moderately correlated with total drives
- Further clustering could identify user segments for personalized outreach
